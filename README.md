## Since tutorials/Practicals were not a requirement for the repo I have left out the practicals

All my practical work was mostly throwaway undocumented code just making sure that I understood what was happening

for that reason I have left them out.

most tutorials are not exactly finished but just an text file saying that the concepts that the tutoial

was teaching is implemented elsewhere in the repo.
